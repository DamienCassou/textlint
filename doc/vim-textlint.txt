*vim-textlint.txt* Writing style checker
                                                     *textlint* *textlint.vim*


TextLint is a ruled-based tool to check for common writing style errors in
natural language. This plugin integrates it with Vim's quickfix feature, to
conveniently navigate between style suggestions in your text.


USAGE                                                         *textlint-usage*

Run TextLint on the current buffer by issuing the command |:TextLint|. When
TextLint is finished, the |quickfix| window will open, with a list of the
stylistic rule matches it found. You can then navigate from the list to the
text using |:cn| and |:cp|; see |quickfix| for details.

Commands ~

:TextLint                                                         *:TextLint*
    Runs TextLint on the file of the current buffer, displaying results in the
    |quickfix| window.

Mappings ~

<leader>tl
    A shortcut for |:TextLint|.


INSTALLATION                                           *textlint-installation*

The nicest way to install |textlint.vim| is via either of:
- Pathogen: https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
- Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

Besides the Vim integration files, the |textlint.vim| distribution contains
the TextLint tool itself as well as integration files for other editors. The
Vim plugin expects to find TextLint relative to where it's installed, so pay
attention to this if you really want to install it the traditional way. You've
been warned.


ABOUT                                                         *textlint-about*

TextLint implements various stylistic rules that its authors collected over
the years, and that are described in:
- "The Elements of Style", by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White
